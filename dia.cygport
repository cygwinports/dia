RELEASE=3
CATEGORY="Graphics"
SUMMARY="GNOME diagram modeller"
DESCRIPTION="Dia is a GTK+ based diagram creation program roughly inspired by
the commercial Windows program 'Visio', though more geared towards informal
diagrams for casual use. It can be used to draw many different kinds of
diagrams. It currently has special objects to help draw entity relationship
diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and many other diagrams.
It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple XML files,
using a subset of SVG to draw the shape."
